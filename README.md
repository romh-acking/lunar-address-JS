# Lunar Address JS

## About
This is a JavaScript port of [Lunar Address](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/26/) and was made with the framework ReactJS.

Lunar Address, being made by FuSoYa, is closed source. After asking about how SNES address conversions work multiple times and never getting a clear cut answer, I decided to take it upon myself to reverse engineer Lunar Address. I used IDA Pro seriously for the first time; fortunately, Lunar Address is small enough for this task to be relatively simple. Per [Klarth](https://github.com/stevemonaco)'s suggestion, I made this app cross-platform and hosted it on GitHub.

This app can be accessed in your browser with the link below:
