# Lunar Address JS

## About
This is a JavaScript port of [Lunar Address](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/26/). Lunar Address, being made by FuSoYa, is closed source. After asking about how SNES address conversions work multiple times and never getting a clear cut answer, I decided to take it upon myself to reverse engineer Lunar Address. I used IDA Pro seriously for the first time; fortunately, Lunar Address is small enough for this task to be relatively easy. Per [Klarth](https://github.com/stevemonaco)'s suggestion, I made a cross-platform program.
